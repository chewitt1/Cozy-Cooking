        <h2>What is Cozy Cooking</h2>
        <p>Cozy Cooking is a page filled with cozy recipes. Initially created as the first project in the Odin Project in November 2022. It has since been revamped as a home for all my favorite cozy recipes.
            <br>Some of these recipes may not be cozy to you but I don't really care. <br>They're cozy to me ok? Good.</p>
        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>Cozy Cooking was created by Carrima Hewitt.</p>
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>This website was built for desktop and was not optimized for mobile. If enough demand rises, this could be part of a future iteration</p>
