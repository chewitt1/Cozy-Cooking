Odin Project Recipes Project

Start Log:

This is the first project in the first course of the Odin Project.
In this project,I am going to build a basic recipe website.
I hope we use CSS (probably not) so I can add some spizzazz.



Mid-way Log:

Change of course- I want to push myself so I am going to try and do a 
cute brutalist site with just one file using the styles tag in head.


End Log:

I think I will stop obsessing over this and move on now. 
This was good practice and fun.
