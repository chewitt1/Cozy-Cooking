        <p>Delicious and easy to make. Carrot cake has held the number position as my favorite cozy food for <i>years</i>. 
            If someone asked me to reccomend them a cake, this would be the first one I think of.
            If you do not have a sweet tooth, beware of this cake though because it has the ability to be <i>very</i> 
            sweet depending on the recipe.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <section>
                    <h4>The Batter</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. 
                            Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottom with parchment paper and then grease the top. 
                            Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.</li>
                        <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C).</li>
                        <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until very well blended.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.</li>
                        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.</li>
                        <li>Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, 
                            then add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Baking Time</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans.</li>
                        <li>Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted 
                            into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Cool cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the cake layers out onto cooling racks. 
                            Remove the parchment paper and cool completely. If you find that a cake layer is sticking to the bottom of the pan, 
                            leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Finishing Up</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time, until fluffy.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the whipping cream. Beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the frosting is whipped and creamy. This frosting resembles the texture of whipped cream. 
                            Chill covered until ready to frost the cake.</li>
                        <li>When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer, and place the second cake layer on top.</li>
                        <li>Add the remaining frosting to the top of the carrot cake and use a butter knife or small spatula to swirl the frosting around. Leave the sides of the cake unfrosted. 
                            Finish with a handful of nuts on top.</li>
                    </ol>
